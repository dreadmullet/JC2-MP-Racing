### Configuring

By default, the script does nothing. You will need to set what mode the script runs in. This is set in server/sSettings.lua.

* **RaceManagerMode** - Runs as a single server-wide gamemode.
* **RaceManagerJoinable** - The old version that ran on the test server that creates joinable races.
